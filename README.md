# 🚗🐾 Vehicles & Animals Image Classification with CIFAR-10

This project implements a complete Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification pipeline using PyTorch, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluated on both the standard test set and real-world smartphone images. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluated on real-world smartphone images to analyze generalization performance.
